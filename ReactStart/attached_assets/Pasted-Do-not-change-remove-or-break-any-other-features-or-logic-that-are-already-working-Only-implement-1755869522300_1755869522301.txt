Do not change, remove, or break any other features or logic that are already working. Only implement what’s written below. If the admin page needs to be reconnected or reconstructed to include the new changes, do it without altering existing working functionality. 1) Deployment & Boot (FIRST — do this before anything else) • Move my Edge Market app to the repo root. • Carefully analyze all files and update any paths/imports/build configs affected by the move. • Install all dependencies (use the lockfile if present). • Start the app with: • Internal port: 5000 (bind on 0.0.0.0:5000) • External port: 80 (expose publicly on port 80) • Ensure the preview keeps running and opening continuously after start (auto-restart on crash, no idle shutdowns). Acceptance for this step: • App runs from the root; package.json and build scripts work at root. • App is reachable on external port 80 and internally on 5000. • Preview stays live and opens successfully (no auto stop). 2) Convert Button • The convert button is not functional and returns “invalid request data.” • Fix it so the convert feature works correctly end-to-end. 3) Deposit & Withdrawal (Crypto Only) + Admin Sync • Deposit and withdrawal pages are not fully synced/linked with the admin dashboard. • The admin still appears to fetch the old deposit logic (credit card), but the system is now 100% crypto. • Reconnect or reconstruct the admin to fully sync with the new crypto-only deposit/withdraw flow. 4) Editable Wallet Addresses in Admin → Reflect on Deposit Page • In the admin dashboard, add the ability to edit all wallet addresses (BTC, ETH, and others). • When admin updates an address, the deposit page must immediately reflect the new address (no stale values). 5) deposit and Withdrawal History (User Dashboard) • deposit and Withdrawal history does not show on the user dashboard. • Implement and wire it so users see complete, accurate withdrawal history and syncs with admin dashboard accurately. 6) Copy Trade (History + Balance) • The copy trade page does not show copy trade history after copying a trade. • Ensure copy trade is properly connected to the trading system. • Balance does not deduct properly when copy trades happen — fix the deduction and ensure totals update correctly. • Ensure copy trades appear in the user’s trade history. 7) News Page • Hide the “Create News” button from the news page (users must not see it). 8) Admin Dashboard Buttons (Sync with User Dashboard) • In the admin panel: • Copy Trade unlock button is not functional — fix it. • Quick Trade unlock button is not functional — fix it. • Both must work and sync correctly with the user dashboard. 9) Signup & Login • Signup does not work — fix it so user creation completes successfully. • Login button does not redirect straight to the dashboard — fix immediate redirect after successful login. Global Constraints (Do Not Violate) • Do not touch or change any other features or logic beyond what is explicitly listed here. • When reconnecting/reconstructing the admin for the new changes, preserve all existing and functioning features exactly as they are (no omissions, no regressions). Completion Check (Must Pass) • App runs from root, dependencies installed, internal 5000 / external 80, preview stays running & opens. • Convert works (no “invalid request data”). • Deposit/Withdraw fully synced with admin using crypto only. • Admin can edit wallet addresses; deposit page reflects changes immediately. • User dashboard shows deposit and withdrawal history. • Copy trade: records history, deducts balances correctly, and syncs everywhere. • Create News button hidden from users. • Copy Trade unlock and Quick Trade unlock buttons in admin are functional and synced with user dashboard. • Signup works; Login redirects directly to dashboard. • No other existing features changed or broken.
